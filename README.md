# VM Simulation

## Description
VM Simulation is a C program developed by Wafik Tawfik to simulate a virtual memory system using various page replacement algorithms, including OPT, NRU, and CLOCK. The program handles memory management tasks such as page allocation, replacement, and tracking access statistics, providing a platform for understanding and analyzing the efficiency of different algorithms in handling page faults.

## Features
- Simulates virtual memory management.
- Supports OPT (Optimal), NRU (Not Recently Used), and CLOCK page replacement algorithms.
- Configurable number of memory frames and refresh rates.
- Detailed statistics reporting including total accesses, page faults, and writes to disk.

## Installation
To compile the program, use the following GCC command:
```bash
gcc -o vmsim vmsim.c
```

## Usage
Run the simulation using the command line with the following format:
```bash
./vmsim -n <numframes> -a <algorithm> [-r <refresh_rate>] <tracefile>
```
Where:
- `<numframes>` is the number of frames in the memory.
- `<algorithm>` can be `opt`, `clock`, or `nru`.
- `<refresh_rate>` is required if using the `nru` algorithm to specify how often the reference bits are reset.
- `<tracefile>` is the path to the memory trace file.

### Example
To run the simulation with 100 frames using the CLOCK algorithm on a file named `trace.txt`, you would use:
```bash
./vmsim -n 100 -a clock trace.txt
```

## Input File Format
The trace file should contain memory access traces where each line specifies a type of memory access and a virtual address. Example of a trace line:
```
L 04f6b869
```

## Output
The program outputs statistics to the standard output, detailing the number of total accesses, page faults, and disk writes. It also prints any errors or important warnings during the execution.
